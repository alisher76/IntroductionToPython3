# When program runs everything will get to stored somewhere in the memory
# When we create a variable by giving a name for instance fruit="apple"
# memory allocates storage for it
# we can name variables like: greeting = "Hello", _myage = 26, ali_job_title = "software engineer"


# converting in python
age = 25 # whole number Integer
name = "Alisher"
salary = 50.550 # Float number
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old.")
